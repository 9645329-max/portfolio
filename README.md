### HAMPSTER SHIP!

Hamster Ship is a fast-paced space shooter made in Processing, where you control a hamster spaceship to shoot falling rocks and avoid collisions. The game uses ArrayLists to manage rocks, lasers, and power-ups, with timers controlling when new ones appear. The main draw() loop handles movement, collisions, scoring, and health updates, while mouse clicks fire lasers. Smart use of object-oriented code and timers makes the gameplay smooth and reactive.
